# MY Experience With Typescript
This was my First Experience with Typescript it was hard for me to learn how to use at first since it is little differenct from javascript .
you may not be satisfied with my work but trust me i did my best this creating my first project if i had little help from anyone i coould have made a better project . 
# What i used :
TailWind ,Next-auth,next, @heroicons And Spotify-Web-api,@herioicons,@material-ui
# Diffuclties:
At first i didn't know how to get accest tokens from app but i had to google and search a lot  to find a solution . but the one thing i could'nt find is how to get freinds activity .it searched and try it all soltuions if soome could help i will be so thankfull
#  The final:
since Spotify won"t communicate with  my app unless you have a Premuim Account to use 
if you host the app with a premuim client_id it will funcional and play ur music easily and smooth .
# Alert:
i am so happy and proud of myself and of my progress since it is my first Project using TypeScript ,Mr.Read if you are Reading this please i want you to know that i assume i can be good employee at ur workspace i learn fast and Hard-worker since i was little kid , i am passionate and full of energy i might i need some help at first but i promise i can be a lot more good hand if have little help and encouragement.









This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
